How to set up and run everything
==============================

1. Install dependencies (from webapp directory):
	You need Python 3.9+.
	Install required packages:
   
	pip install fastapi uvicorn apscheduler python-multipart passlib[bcrypt] itsdangerous sqlalchemy requests starlette

2. Start the Desk Simulator API:
	From the project root, run:
   
	python simulator/main.py --port 8001
   
	(You can change the port or add options, see README.md for details)

3. Initialize the user database (optional,if its not already there and only first time):
	From the webapp directory, run:
   
	python init_user_db.py

4. Start the web application:
	From the webapp directory, run:
   
	uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080

	The web interface will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080

5. Log in:
	Default users are auto-created for each desk (see logins.txt or init_user_db.py for details), and an admin user:
	- Username: admin
	- Password: adminpass

6. The webapp will connect to the simulator API at http://127.0.0.1:8001 by default.

7.. To change scheduled desk movements, edit scheduleconfig.json in the webapp directory.
